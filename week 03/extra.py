#  message = 'I have eaten' + 99 + 'burritios.
# print(message)
# this gives an error as cant add strings to integers
# fix it by using:

message = 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos'
print(message)

#eggs is valid as begins with a letter, 100 is not valid as can't begin a variable with a number

# int(), float(), str()
